# I'm Blake Johnson.
* I'm a software engineer working at Coursera

* I like to be entertained, especially by the following things:
  * movies (Here's my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/bonkjohnson/))
  * music (Here's my [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/bonkjohnson))
  * platform fighters
  * various beers
* I like creating things, including:
  * noises on synthesizers (Here's my
  [bandcamp](https://officechair.bandcamp.com/))
  * art projects for my loved ones
  * programming projects for myself (Here's my remarkably bare
